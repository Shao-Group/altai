# Overview

## **This project is in progress. It's not guaranteed to function properly.**

Altai (**Al**lele-specific **T**ranscript **A**ssembly **I**nstrument) is a reference-based allele-specific transcript assembler. It incorporates variations, e.g. SNPs in a vcf file, in the transcript assembly to assemble the full-length transcript sequences by assigning those variations to their correct phases, i.e. alleles. Its output transcript sequences are expected to be the actual allele-specific sequences rather than subsequences of the reference genome.

Part of Altai is developed based on [Scallop](https://github.com/Kingsford-Group/scallop) ([license](https://github.com/Kingsford-Group/scallop/blob/master/LICENSE)).

# Installation

Altai uses additional libraries of Boost, htslib. If they have not been installed in your system, you first need to download and install them.

## Download Boost

If Boost has not been downloaded/installed, download Boost [(license)](http://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt) from (www.boost.org).
Uncompress it somewhere (compiling and installing are not necessary).

## Install htslib

If htslib has not been installed, download htslib [(license)](https://github.com/samtools/htslib/blob/develop/LICENSE) from (www.htslib.org/) with version 1.5 or higher. Note that htslib relies on zlib. So if zlib has not been installed in your system, you need to install zlib first. 

Use the following commands to build htslib:

```
./configure --disable-bz2 --disable-lzma --disable-gcs --disable-s3 --enable-libcurl=no
make
make install
```

The default installation location of htslib is `/usr/lib`. If you would install it to a different location, replace the above `configure` line with the following (by adding `--prefix=/path/to/your/htslib` to the end):

```
./configure --disable-bz2 --disable-lzma --disable-gcs --disable-s3 --enable-libcurl=no --prefix=/path/to/your/htslib
```

In this case, you also need to export the runtime library path (note that there is an additional `lib` following the installation path):

```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/your/htslib/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

## Compile Altai

Use the following to compile Altai:

```
./configure --with-htslib=/path/to/your/htslib --with-boost=/path/to/your/boost
make
```

If some of the dependencies are installed in the default system directory (for example, `/usr/lib`),
then the corresponding `--with-` option might not be necessary. The executable file `altai` will appear at `src/altai`.

# Usage

The usage of `altai` is:

```
./altai -i <input.bam> -j <variants.vcf> [-G <genome.fa>] [--chr <comma,seperated,chr,without,space] -o <output-prefix> [options]
```

If you would like to output the transcript sequences, `-G <genome.fa>` is necessary. Otherwise, it's optional. The default of `--chr` is `1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,X` which is for human genome. If you are not using human sample or interested in other chromosomes, you need to change it accoridingly.

The `input.bam` is the read alignment file generated by some RNA-seq aligner, (for example, TopHat2, STAR, or HISAT2).
Make sure that it is sorted; otherwise run `samtools` to sort it:

```
samtools sort input.bam > input.sort.bam
```

The reconstructed allele-specific transcripts shall be written as gtf format into `output-prefix.gtf`. Their sequences will be written as fasta format into `output-prefix.fa`.

The `variants.vcf` is a variant calling format file generated by some variant caller from DNA or RNA, or downloaded from a database. Variants should be phased. The 10th column has `GT` field and the 11th column have sample-specific genotype, e.g. `1|0` means allele 1 has alternative genotype and allele2 has reference genotype.

Make sure the vcf file is also sorted (with contigs in the same order as the bam file); otherwise run [bcftools](https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html) to sort it:

```sh
bcftools sort input.vcf > output.vcf
```

The reconstructed allele-specific transcripts shall be written as gvf format into `output-prefix.gvf`. Their sequences will be written as fasta format into `output-prefix.fa`. Note that **`altai` only outputs allele-specific transcripts**. If you want to have a complete allele-specific transcriptome with both allele-specific transcripts (two alleles different) and non-allele-specific transcripts (both alleles same), run the pipline below.

## Assemble an allele-specific transcriptome 

This is a complete pipeline of how to assemble an allele-specific transcriptome using Altai and a non-allele-specific transcript assembler (e.g. [Scallop](https://github.com/Kingsford-Group/scallop)).

## Identify allele-specifically differentially expressed  transcripts

After assembling an allele-specific transcriptome, users can obtain a `gvf` file and a `fasta` file. This 

although `altai` and `scallop` report a coverage value for every transcript,
